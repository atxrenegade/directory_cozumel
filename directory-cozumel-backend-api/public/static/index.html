          <p style='font-size: 2rem;font-weight:500;'>This is a free local directory for all Cozumel businesses, residents and
          visitors alike. It was created for anyone looking to make the most of their experience on the island.<br><br> 
          
          Directory Cozumel was created after my frustration with having to wade through multiple websites and forums to find accurate up-to-date information about island businesses and services.  Features include: user contributed ratings, photos, maps and reviews, and even a section for CoVid reopening dates and operating details. Directory Cozumel is mobile responsive and desktop
          friendly.</p>

          <h3>Free to Use, Free to List</h3>
          <p>Through the use of strategically placed sponsored ad listings we are able to make Directory Cozumel free for users and free to business owners who want to list their businesses making this a resource accessible to all businesses not just those who that can afford expensive advertising options.</p>
          <h3>Support Local and Sustainable Business</h3>
          <p>Every month Directory Cozumel spotlights a new local Mexican owned business in the Local Spotlight section giving
          back to the businesses that make up the Cozumel we love. We've also made a point to highlight sustainable businesses
          in the community, and they can now be found easily by using the search bar and searching the sustainable businesses
          category. </p>

          <h3>Updated and Verified </h3>
          <p>Ten years ago I created a business listing for a client on google maps. Nine years ago that business shut down, today it is still on google maps as an active business. Directory Cozumel verifies it's listings, allows users to flag and suggest updates for a world that's constantly changing so the information we deliver is relevant, accurate and up-to-date. </p>
